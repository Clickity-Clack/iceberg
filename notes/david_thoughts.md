I am excited to train AI against the same AI. [Similar to Google's AlphaZero.](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch)

Things to do first before making AI
* good public api
* basic working game and UI
* possibly some kind of move notation [Chess notation for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_notation#Notation_systems_for_humans)
  * its already a thing! http://pentolla.com/beginner/
  * http://lut.eee.u-ryukyu.ac.jp/dc14/
* replay system or gif maker using the move notation

What information is needed for each turn?
* the board (should it be the pieces and colors or a matrix of cells and a color?)
* each person's remaining pieces
  * include number of tile counts?
* turn rotation?
  * (would that matter to anyone? humans get to see the rotation!) 
  * exclude people who have given up?
* whose turn?
