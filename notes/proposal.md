Project Introduction

We would like to make an online replica of the turn-based strategy game [Blokus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blokus). Player own a set of identical polyominos. 


Players take turns placing polyomino

The game will be one verses one; human verses human, AI verses human, and AI verses AI.
